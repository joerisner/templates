# TypeScript

## tsconfig.json

- Root level of project (usually)
- There is additional config and packages needed in order to get TS working correctly with ESLint. See these other files as well:
  - [package.json](../versioning/package.json)
  - [.eslintrc.json](../linters/.eslintrc.json)
- Setting the `baseUrl` option allows for using absolute paths in import statements
