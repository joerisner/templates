# Templates

This is a collection of template files for various development tools that I prefer to use in projects. I build different types of apps using different frameworks - Rails, Bridgetown, Node, etc. - and rather than creating several "template" repositories for each of those frameworks, I decided to just create a collection of configurations that I could reference and utilize any time I need to.

I also chose to include explanatory comments with details on some of my configuration decisions here in this repository, but those can obviously be removed after importing to individual projects.
